# University-RPG
This was a game I creating alongside my GameDev.TV Unity 2D course. This project has since been abandoned due to the priority of other projects however, this will be restarted later in the future as a new Git Repo. 

## About
Inspired by ther hit game Bully, I game is based on a generic university where the player creates there character whom is about to begin their university career.  

The Player Designs their character messing around with cosemetics, stats, and university course before beginning university. Whilst on campus, the player is given a sandbox opportuinity in what to do:
- They can attend lecturers (on takes one IRL second) which increase some but not all of their skills. Their course will assign them exams and coursework:
  - To complete the coursework, the player will be transported to a virtual arena in which they will have to defend off against waves of different enemies. They will have to ability to save and continue later on but will not know when they have finished all the waves. Once the deadline for the course has hit, the player will recieve a percentage indicating how many waves they have done. This will be their grade for that course work.
  - To complete exams, the player will be transported to a virtual arena in which they will have to defeat a boss. The bosses health will be invisible and the player has to defeat the boss within a certain time limit. If they do not defat the boss within the time limit, they will finish the exams an will recieve a percentage indicating how much of the bosses health did they destroy. This will be their fgrade for that exam.
 The player will use their skills they've levelled up from their lectures to defat the enemies. Each enemy with be unique to the course. Foor instance, eletrical based enemies will be unique to the engineering course whilst slime based painting enemies will be unique to the Art course. At the end of each semester, they will get an overall grade. If the overall grade is not above a certain percentage, they will fail the course and be kicked out of university.
- The player can join societies which will act as factions trying to take up the school. The player will gain certain abilities whilst in a faction and be abel to level up and gain more abilities by attending more society based activities. To take over the university and defeat other societies, the player will be transported to a virtual arena where societies face off against each other.
- The player can socialise with other NPC allowing for romance based options. Again, do so will elvel up certain social skills and allow for a different play through.
- The player can join sports teams which will act similarily to societies and lectures where the player can attend training to level up skills and then apply these skills in tournaments. To complete a tournament, the player will have to defeat a Boss within a virtual arena. Again, the boss will be unique to that sport. For instance, if the player was apart fo the swimming team ,the boss may be a shark with water based attacks.

The player will require the need for socialising, food, sleep, and activities and will have to balance their life as different events will clash with each other. If the player fails to balance their life accordingly, they will gain negative effects which will impact all areas of focus. And if they do not focus on their course, they will be kicked from university if they fail their course. However, using their social network, they could persaude their fellow studetns to help them get a better grade or even stay on the course if they fail.

It is up to the player what path they take at university.

## Version
